# TLConvertor

This is a small web app to convert text copied from Word to a "clean" html, which is needed for correct text formatting display in the tl.rulate.ru's text editor.

## Note

It's the most first project I've done just before I decided to become a web developer. I didn't know nothing beyond of basics from many programming languages I scratched, so I had to google literally every step during the process of developing.  
Although the project isn't perfect at all, but it affected me a lot and gave understanding of things I want to do in my life _(and also it's not that bad especially for the thing I've done even before learning html and css)_.

I tidied up a bit recently, but didn't change anything drastically. Everything stays the way it was from the most beginning. I'm going to keep it like this, even though there are many obvious mistakes which are easy to fix.

### But...

I'll make second version of the app, with my new knowledge.
